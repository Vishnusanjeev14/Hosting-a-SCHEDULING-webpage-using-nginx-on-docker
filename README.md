# Hosting-a-SCHEDULING-webpage-using-nginx-on-docker
The project focuses on hosting a webpage using, a high-performance open-source web server and reverse proxy. The project will provide an understanding of how web servers interact with operating systems to serve web content efficiently.


In this project, Nginx is deployed on a Windows-based operating system. The setup process involves installing Nginx through docker, configuring the server to host both static and dynamic content, and managing server processes. A key focus is understanding how Nginx optimizes resource usage and performance through its worker process model, which utilizes multiple child processes and an asynchronous, non-blocking event-driven architecture.
